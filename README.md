# greta-examples
R scripts for data analysis using the greta package:

* `mtcars.R`: Simple linear regression with and without factors for the mtcars data set
* `milk.R`: Mixed models with the nlme `Milk` data set. Random-intercept model.

Also provided: `setup.R` with some specific tweaks I had to use to get greta to work on Ubuntu 16.04
